This is a simple Chip8 Disassembler I have been working on.
This was mainly used to ensure the Chip8 Assembler I was working would work.
This should be used in conjunction with the Chip8 Emulator found here: https://github.com/jonesdy/Chip8-Emulator
and the Chip8 Assembler found here: https://github.com/jonesdy/Chip8-Assembler
More information about Chip8 can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8 or http://www.chip8.com/
